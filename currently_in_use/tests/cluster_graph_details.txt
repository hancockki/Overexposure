# Prints each node weight on a new line followed by each edge. 
# Ie the first number printed is the weight of node 0. Then prints each edge followed by its weight and the rejecting nodes.
# For example, 0 2 1 -22 indicates that there is an edge (0,2) with weight 1, and the rejecting node in that edge is node 22.
