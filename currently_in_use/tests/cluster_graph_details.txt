Prints each node weight on a new line followed by each edge. 
 Ie the first number printed is the weight of node 0. Then prints each edge followed by its weight and the rejecting nodes.
 For example, 0 2 1 -22 indicates that there is an edge (0,2) with weight 1, and the rejecting node in that edge is node 22.
